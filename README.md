# BuycraftSharp

BuycraftSharp is a simple C# library for interacting with the [Buycraft.net](http://buycraft.net) API.

## Development

This library is developed on Mono 3.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, as that is the only OS I have. While I'd like to use LINQ, I can't :(

Also, I am relatively new to C# development, so my code quality will be a bit poor. Please send pull requests!
